# Image Drone

A DigiSIS project applying machine learning techniques for automatic classification of drone images.

## Workflow

 1. **[Exploratory analysis](./notebooks/drone_ml_image_class.ipynb)**. A initial attempt at creating a training dataset and applying a simple Random Forest classifier.
 
 2. **[Refining the classification scheme](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/JamesSample/image_drone/blob/master/notebooks/drone_ml_janne.ipynb)**. Using mosiaced images with a more detailed training dataset to see how much detail can be reasonably extracted using a simple random forest algorithm.
